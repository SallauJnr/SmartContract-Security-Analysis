# Smart Contract Security Analysis

## üìå Overview
This repository contains a Python-based blockchain security analysis tool designed to evaluate the performance of different blockchain architectures (Ethereum, Hyperledger, and Lightweight) and their consensus mechanisms. It also integrates **SolidCheck.io** for smart contract vulnerability detection.

## üõ† Features
- **Blockchain Performance Analysis**:  
  - Evaluates throughput, latency, energy consumption, and scalability.  
  - Compares **Ethereum, Hyperledger, and Lightweight blockchains**.  
- **Consensus Mechanism Evaluation**:  
  - Tests **Proof of Authority (PoA), Proof of Stake (PoS), and Proof of Work (PoW)**.  
- **Smart Contract Security Analysis**:  
  - Detects vulnerabilities using **SolidCheck.io**.  
  - Categorizes issues into **Critical, High, Medium, and Low** severity levels.  
- **Visualization**:  
  - Generates **bar charts** for performance and security analysis.
